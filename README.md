# Module 2 Capstone - TEnmo

This is a transfer program that I created in tandem with three other developers in an agile environment.

The program uses a command line client interface and the program is a Restful API written fully in Java using Spring.

The database has been created using PostgreSQL.

The program handles security through Spring security.

you start the program by first running the API application in order to access the database, and then opening the client side program.
